Project for Class Intro to Database
Build a course evaluation system using flask, html, css, bootstramp, jquery, javascript,MySQL

Project Description
1. Design, develop, and implement a timely course evaluation system.
2. There are two user-types for the system: students and professors.
3. The students can select (“tick”) a metric (excellent, very good, etc.) to
evaluate the class that just finished and provide comments and suggestions as
typed-in text.
4. Only the students enrolled in the class can access the system. Once logged
in, their responses must be anonymous.
5. The system should support simultaneous access by all students registered
in the course.
6. The system should handle each student “session” as a single transaction.
The students can select (“tick”) a metric and provide comments/suggestions
or “tick” a metric (providing comments/suggestions without selecting a
metric is not possible).
7. Professors can produce reports (total numbers for each metric by class
session for each course, total numbers for each metric by semester-up-to-date
for each course, comparisons between metrics for two consecutive class
sessions for each course, and charts for every report).
